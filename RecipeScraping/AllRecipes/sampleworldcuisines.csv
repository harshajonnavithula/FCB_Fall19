Heat a wok and add the oil for frying. When the oil is hot, add the garlic and stir fry until aromatic (about 30 seconds). Add the chicken cubes and pork. Stir fry until they turn white and are 80 percent cooked through.
Add the sausages and the drained mushrooms. Stir fry for another minute.
In a small bowl, combine the rice wine with the light soy and dark soy sauce. In a separate small bowl, dissolve the cornflour in one tablespoon of water, and whisk it into the sauce.

Actually, if you can get this done ahead of time (up to 1 day), so much the better, but even 20 minutes is fine.
Make the hot sauce by mixing together the mayonnaise and the gochujang paste (or other hot sauce) in a small bowl. Set aside.
For the corn relish, put the canned sweetcorn into a bowl. Add the chilli to the sweetcorn, along with the chopped coriander and some salt to taste. Give it all a good stir, and set aside.
Cut the fish fillets in half lengthways, so you have long fingers, and arrange in a shallow roasting tin. Mix together the cumin, paprika and salt, and sprinkle over the fish fillets. Mix the garlic and the oil in a small bowl. Drizzle the fish with the garlicky oil, and roast in the oven for 8–10 minutes, depending on the thickness of your fillets. Check to see if the fish is cooked through (though only just) before taking out of the oven.
Once you’ve taken the fish out (though don’t let it get cold) turn off the oven and warm the tortillas in the fading heat. Meanwhile, peel, stone and slice the avocados, then spritz with the juice of the lime, ready to serve with the other accompaniments.
Arrange the fish on a plate (lined with salad leaves, if so desired), sprinkle with some chopped fresh coriander, and take to the table along with the warmed tortillas. If you don’t want to add any salad to the fish directly, you may want to put a bowl of shredded iceberg or some other crisp leaves nearby.
Put the bowls of soused, but drained, red onions, the corn relish, hot sauce and a plate of sliced avocados on the table so that everyone can load their tortillas. A plate of lime wedges and a pile of napkins are both good ideas, too.",,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/fish_tacos_33979

Add the onions, cover the pan and leave to cook for around 15 minutes, or until they are soft and translucent, occasionally stirring. Add the chicken, coriander, garlic, ras el hanout, turmeric, ginger, pepper and ½ tsp salt. Stir to combine and cook, uncovered, for 5 minutes.
Pour in the chicken stock and bring to the boil over a high heat. Cover the pan, reduce the heat to medium–low and leave to simmer gently, stirring occasionally, for 50 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through. Add a few tablespoons of water if it looks dry at any point. Remove the chicken from the pan with a slotted spoon and set aside to cool. Once cooled, cut into 1cm/½ in pieces and return to the fridge until ready to use.
Stir the honey and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon into the pan and continue cooking over a medium–low heat, uncovered and stirring occasionally, for 50 minutes, until the onions are golden brown and all the liquid has evaporated. Leave to cool.
Meanwhile, prepare the rest of the filling. Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6. Spread the almonds and pistachios over a baking tray and roast for about 10–12 minutes, giving them a good stir halfway through to ensure even roasting. Remove from the oven and leave to cool to room temperature. Grind using a food processor or crush with a rolling pin or pestle until coarsely ground. Mix with the caster sugar and the remaining cinnamon in a small bowl.
Melt 10g/1/3oz of butter in a small frying pan. Break the 5 eggs into the pan, add a pinch of salt and cook, while stirring, for a few minutes until scrambled and fully set. Transfer to a bowl and leave to cool.
Melt the remaining butter. Use a sharp knife to cut the filo pastry sheets into twelve 22-cm/8½in squares. Keep them covered with a tea towel to prevent drying out. Lay a filo square on a work surface and lightly brush with melted butter, then top with another filo pastry square and brush with butter. Place the two layers of filo in a small, shallow dish that is around 10cm/4in in diameter, with any excess pastry overhanging the edges.
Preheat the oven again to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6 and line a baking tray with baking paper.
Add the filling ingredients to the dish in the following order: chicken pieces, onions, scrambled eggs, ground nuts and lemon zest. Each portion should be enough to cover the base of the dish, bearing in mind that you will need six portions of all of the fillings for each pie.
Fold the overhanging pastry over the top of the filling and brush lightly with melted butter. Carefully flip the pies over and remove from the dish.

Rub the seasoning into the meat and set aside.
Heat the oil in a large frying pan and fry the onions and peppers with the thyme and bay leaves for 3 minutes, while stirring. Add the chicken and seasoning and cook for another 3 minutes, turning the chicken regularly until it is starting to colour. Add the chorizo and garlic and fry for 2 minutes more. Add the tomatoes and cook for 5 minutes or until they are softened and juicy, stirring regularly.
Tilt the pan so that the liquid runs to one side and sprinkle the flour over the vegetables, chicken and chorizo. Stir it in quickly, then set the pan level and stir the cooking liquor into the flour. Doing it this way should prevent little clumps of flour – but don’t worry if you do have a few, no-one will notice.

Turn off the heat and stir through the ground almonds, lemon zest and chopped walnuts. Tip into a bowl and leave to cool completely.
To make the pastry, place the flour in a bowl and pour in the oil. Gradually pour in 100ml/3½fl oz water, mixing constantly with your hands until you have a fairly firm dough (you may not need all the water). Tip out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until you have a smooth, stretchy dough. Roll the dough into a ball, place in a clean bowl, cover and leave to rest for 10 minutes.
Place the dough on a lightly floured surface. Divide the dough into 16 equal pieces. Take one of the pieces and roll out into a circle about 9cm/3½in in diameter. Drop a heaped teaspoon of the apple mixture in the centre of the circle.
Pinch small folds on opposite sides of the circle, pull them together (over the filling) and pinch them together at the top to hold them in place. Repeat the pinching again with the unfolded sides and gently push into the centre to create a four-petal flower shape. Using your fingers, pinch the dough together to reinforce the shape of the momo and gently tease the holes open (if necessary). Repeat the process with the remaining dough and filling.
Lightly grease the bowl of your steamer and add the momos. Cook for 9 minutes, or until the dough is cooked through.
To make the sauce, place the ghee, sugar and cream in a small saucepan and melt together over a medium heat. Turn the heat up and bring the sauce to a low simmer. Cook for 1 minute then stir in the saffron and take the sauce off the heat.

Whisk the eggs in a large bowl until smooth and slowly pour the butter and sugar mixture on top, stirring constantly until well combined.
Put the flour and cocoa powder in a sieve and sift on top of the egg and butter mixture. Beat hard with a wooden spoon until smooth. Leave to cool for 10 minutes. (This will prevent the chocolate chunks melting too quickly when they are added to the batter.)
Put all the chocolate on a board and cut into chunky pieces with a large knife. You want the chunks to be around 1.5cm/¾in. Break the pecan nuts or walnuts in half. Stir the chocolate pieces, cherries and nuts into the cake batter. Pour into the prepared tin and spread to all the corners with a rubber spatula or the back of a spoon.
Bake the brownie in the centre of the oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the mixture is crusty on the surface and lightly cooked inside. Do not allow it to overcook as the cake will become spongy rather than gooey in the centre.
Remove from the oven and leave to cool for 5-10 minutes. Take out of the tin and transfer to a board. Cut into squares or rectangles to serve warm or leave to cool completely if serving cold.

Mix the water and oil together and gradually pour it onto the flour, mixing as you go. You’re looking for a soft, but not sticky dough. If the mix is too wet, add a sprinkling of flour.
Once the dough has come together, take it out of the bowl and start kneading. The dough should be at a consistency where you shouldn’t need any flour to knead. Work the dough for about 10-15 minutes, or until it has a smooth appearance. Wrap in cling film and leave to rest in the fridge for a minimum of one hour.
While the dough is resting, make the filling. Heat a large wide pan with a lid over a medium heat. Wash the spinach thoroughly and add it to the pan, squashing it down if necessary. Season with salt and pepper and put the lid on.
Let the spinach cook down for about five minutes, stirring occasionally until it’s completely cooked. Drain into a colander and press with the back of a spoon to get rid of as much moisture as possible. Press down with kitchen paper to remove any excess moisture. Return to the pan to further dry out, and add the nutmeg and lemon zest.
Turn off the heat and leave until completely cool. Once cold, stir through the egg, crumble in the feta and mix thoroughly. Check the seasoning and add salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste.
Before making the pastry it is important to have everything ready. Lay out a large sheet of baking parchment and dust generously with cornflour. Melt the butter ready for brushing the pastry and have a flat baking tray buttered and a pasta machine ready. Preheat the oven to 175C/350F/Gas 4.
To make the pastry, divide it into five equal balls keeping them covered with a damp tea towel to prevent drying. Take one ball and flatten to a rough rectangle using a rolling pin. Sprinkle your hands and the pastry liberally with cornflour.
Beginning with the widest setting, pass the pastry through the pasta machine, and continue until it has gone through to setting number seven (of nine). You don’t want to take it through the thinnest setting, as you need to be able to stretch it more with your hands. Using the back of your hands gently stretch the pastry width ways until it is as thin as you can manage. Don’t worry about the odd hole, as the layers should cover this up.

Lightly stir in the yeast and leave in a warm place for about 10 minutes or until a beige foam floats on the surface. Stir in the flour to make a thick paste, then cover with cling film and leave at room temperature for 24 hours. At the end of the 24 hours the paste will smell yeasty and slightly fermented – a bit like beer.
For the bread dough, pour the water into a jug and stir in the sugar. Lightly stir in the yeast and leave in a warm place for about 10 minutes or until a beige foam floats on the surface.
Stir the flours and salt together in a large bowl, then make a well in the centre and add the yeast and water mixture, the starter dough and the oil.
Mix with a wooden spoon and then with your hands until the mixture comes together and forms a slightly lumpy and sticky dough. If the dough feels a little dry, add another tablespoon or two of water.
Transfer the dough to a work surface and knead for a good 10 minutes until it’s smooth and elastic. As you knead, push the dough away from you with the heel of your hand to stretch it as long as possible, then fold it back towards you. This will help strengthen the flour and trap air bubbles inside the loaf. Resist the temptation to add too much extra flour as it could make the dough dry. You should feel the dough change in texture as you work, so don’t be afraid to be fairly robust with your stretching and folding. Put the dough in an oiled mixing bowl, cover it loosely with oiled cling film and leave it to rise for about an hour or until it has doubled in size.
Line a baking tray with parchment and dust with flour.
Loosen the dough with a spatula and tip it on to the baking tray. Stretch the dough very gently until it’s about 30cm/12in long, then fold it in half and stretch again. Do the same thing twice more. This should help to give the dough a more holey texture.
After the third stretch, shape the dough into a long loaf shape and slash the top a few times with a sharp knife. Dust with a little flour and leave to prove in a warm place for 45–60 minutes or until it has risen again and feels light and puffy.
Preheat the oven to 240C/450F/Gas 8.
Bake the loaf for 20–25 minutes or until golden-brown and crusty. The base should sound hollow when tapped. Cool on a wire rack.",,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/rustic_spanish_bread_pan_97488

Crumble the fresh yeast into the bowl by rubbing it between your fingertips or add the instant yeast. Whisk in the milk until the ferment is thick and smooth. Set aside for at least two hours at room temperature and out of draughts. The ferment will start to bubble.
Add the ferment to the bowl of a freestanding mixer with a dough hook attached. Add all the batter ingredients and beat until the mixture is smooth and elastic (this will take about 10 minutes).
Grease the moulds heavily with butter. I find it easier to pipe the mixture into the moulds using a large piping bag fitted with a large plain nozzle, but, if you don’t want to do this, you can just moisten your hands with water then scoop out small pieces of batter with your fingers and drop them into the moulds. Either way, fill the moulds two-thirds full.
Place the moulds on baking trays and leave in a warm place for about 40-50 minutes, or until the mixture has risen about 1cm/½in above the rims of the moulds.
Preheat the oven to 190C/375F/Gas 5.
For the syrup, put the orange and lemon peel in a pan. Add the orange and lemon juice, sugar and 500ml/18fl oz water. Bring to the boil, then turn down the heat and simmer for about 5-10 minutes, or until it thickens slightly to form a syrup. Take off the heat, add the rum and allow to cool until just warm.
Pour the syrup into a large dish wide enough to hold all the babas (you may need to use more than one dish).
Bake the babas in the preheated oven for about 10-15 minutes, or until they are golden-brown and have risen up to resemble champagne corks. Carefully turn each one out of its mould and leave cool on a wire rack. (At this point, any babas that you don’t want to use immediately can be stored for up to three months in the freezer.)
Put the babas into the syrup, turning them to coat thoroughly, and leave for 2-3 hours at room temperature so that they soak up as much syrup as possible. Very gently prod them occasionally - when they feel soft, they are ready.
To serve, place a baba in each serving bowl. Scoop out some of the strips of peel from the syrup – a pair of kitchen tweezers is ideal for this – and curl on top of each baba. Spoon over a little of the syrup and serve with Chantilly cream and a little extra rum.",,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/rum_baba_85737

Make a well in the centre and pour in the oil. Add the tomatoes, if using, and start mixing the wet ingredients into the flour mixture with your hands. Gradually add the milk and work until it all comes together in a slightly sticky dough – you may not need all the liquid. Knead on a lightly floured work surface until the dough is smooth and pliable. Place the dough back in the bowl, cover with a damp teatowel and leave to rest for up to 1 hour.
Divide the dough into 12 pieces. Heat 2cm/¾in oil in a griddle pan or skillet over a medium–low heat. Do not allow the pan to get too hot as the outside of the bread will burn before the inside is cooked. Shape the dough into rounds and roll them out as thinly as possible – they should be around 13–14cm/5–5½in in diameter. Place a flatbread on the pan and flatten again by pressing all over with your fingertips – it will look dimpled. Grill for a few minutes on each side until golden brown, lightly charred and slightly puffed up. Keep the cooked flatbreads warm while you cook the remaining flatbreads.
Mix the butter with the salt and coriander in a small bowl. Spoon this butter mixture over the hot flatbreads so it melts and serve with the Tex-Mex beef chilli.",,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/flatbreads_with_55087

When you’re ready to cook, preheat the oven to 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7. Remove the chicken from the fridge and allow it to reach room temperature.
Tip the contents of the freezer bag into a shallow roasting tin – mine measures 44x34x1.5cm/17x13x½in – and make sure all the chicken thighs are lying flat and not on top of one another (if possible) before roasting in the hot oven for 30 minutes, by which time they should be cooked through (though obviously you must check) and golden on top.
When the chicken’s more or less cooked, make the sauce simply by combining the yoghurt with the tahini and garlic, stir and salt to taste, and sprinkle with a few pomegranate seeds.
Line a platter or a couple of plates with crisp lettuce, shredded or torn into pieces, and then top with the piping hot chicken, pouring the oily juices over them, unless you are, for some inexplicable reason, anti-oily-juices. If you wanted to make the chicken go further, you could cut the thighs into chunky slices rather than leaving them whole.

Kimchi,0,1 item(s),https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/food/ic/food_16x9_832/recipes/kimchi_69909_16x9.jpg,"['1 large Chinese leaf cabbage (700g/1lb 9oz), washed, quartered and cut into 3–4cm/1¼–1½in-wide slices', '50g/1¾oz fine sea salt', '4–6 garlic cloves (20g/¾oz), peeled', '20g/¾oz fresh root ginger, peeled and thickly sliced', '20g/¾oz gochugaru (Korean chilli flakes)', '150g/5½oz mooli (Chinese radish), peeled and cut into 3mm-wide strips that are around 5cm/2in long', '5 spring onions, cut into 3mm-wide strips that are around 5cm/2in long', '100g/3½oz (approximately 1 medium) carrot, peeled and cut into 3mm-wide strips that are around 5cm/2in long']","Wash your equipment thoroughly in warm soapy water, then rinse well under very hot water and leave to air dry.
Put the cabbage in the clean mixing bowl and separate using your fingers. Arrange in layers, with a little salt sprinkled between each layer. Cover the bowl with a plate and leave to stand for 2–3 hours. The cabbage will soften and become limp, and should be sitting in a pool of water when you return to it. It will have reduced in volume by about a third.
Drain the salted cabbage in the clean colander, then return to the bowl. Cover with cold filtered water and swirl the cabbage around, then set aside to soak for 10 minutes. Drain in the colander and return to the bowl. The cabbage should taste slightly salty.
In a blender or pestle and mortar, grind the garlic, ginger and chilli flakes to a paste.
Add the mooli, spring onion and carrot to the cabbage and tip in the chilli paste. Wearing disposable, or clean, new, rubber gloves (to protect your hands from the chilli) thoroughly massage the paste into the vegetables. You can do this with a spoon, but it is less effective.
Spoon the cabbage mixture into the clean jar until it comes up to just under the top of the jar. There is no need to pack it too tightly but you don’t want too much air to reach the surface of the vegetables. Cover with the lid and fasten securely.
Leave in a cool, dark place at room temperature (around 18–20C) for 2–3 days. If your room is warmer, the kimchi will ferment more quickly. Taste the kimchi. If it tastes spicy, sour and slightly cheesy with a good umami flavour, it can be transferred to the fridge to slow down the fermentation process.
In particularly warm weather, you may see small bubbles appearing in the kimchi, which shows the vegetables are creating the lactic acid needed to preserve them. Even in the fridge, you may need to ‘burp’ the container to release the gas after a few days.
You can begin to eat your kimchi right away, but it will continue to ripen and become more fully flavoured the longer it is fermented. You’ll get to know which degree of flavour you prefer. If you are dipping in regularly, you may inadvertently introduce other bacteria to the jar, so it's best consumed within a week or two.",,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/kimchi_69909

Chicken and chorizo empanadas,30,10 item(s),https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/food/ic/food_16x9_832/recipes/chicken_and_chorizo_26918_16x9.jpg,"['4 chicken thighs, on the bone and skin on', '1 tbsp olive oil', '1 onion, finely chopped', '1 garlic clove, crushed', '100g/3½oz British-style chorizo, finely diced', '½ tsp cumin seeds', '50g/1¾oz raisins', 'salt and pepper', '150g/5½oz unsalted butter', '300g/10½oz plain flour', 'large pinch salt', '1 free-range egg, lightly beaten', 'beaten egg, to finish']","Heat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.
For the filling, put the chicken thighs in a small roasting dish, season well all over with salt and pepper and roast for about 45 minutes, or until cooked through. Set aside to cool a little.
Meanwhile, make the pastry. Melt the butter and leave it to cool slightly. Put the flour in a large bowl and mix in the salt. Pour in the butter and egg. Start mixing, adding 3-5 tablespoons of water as you go, until you have a soft dough. Turn this out onto a clean work surface and knead it gently for a couple of minutes, or until smooth. Return the dough to its bowl, cover and set aside to rest while you prepare the filling.
To finish the filling, heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium-low heat. Add the onion and cook for 10–12 minutes, or until soft.
Add the garlic, chorizo, cumin seeds and raisins. Cook over a medium heat for 5–8 minutes, stirring often, until the chorizo is cooked. Remove from the heat.
Once the chicken thighs are cool enough to handle, remove the skin. Pull all the meat from the bones and chop it roughly. Add to the chorizo mixture. Taste and add salt and pepper if needed (the chorizo is already quite salty), then leave to cool completely.
Turn the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6 and line a large baking tray with baking parchment.
Lightly flour the work surface and roll out the dough to a thickness of 3-4mm. Use a 12cm/4½in cutter or a small bowl to cut out 10 discs. You will probably need to re-roll the offcuts once to get this many. Divide the filling between the discs. Dampen the edges of the dough with water then fold over one half of each disc to make a semicircular parcel. Press the edges together firmly then crimp or press the edges with a fork.
Put the empanadas on the baking tray and brush with beaten egg. Bake for 15–20 minutes, or until golden-brown. Eat them warm, on their own or with a chilli sauce.",,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/chicken_and_chorizo_26918

Bring to the boil on a medium-high heat, cover with a lid and transfer to the oven for 30–40 minutes, or until the chicken legs are cooked and tender. Set aside to cool.
Once cool, remove the meat from the chicken bones. The bones can be reserved and used for a stock. Break the meat into bite-sized pieces before transferring to a bowl. Strain the stock, reserving the celery and discarding the bay leaves, and measure out the liquid. You should have about 750ml/1 pint 6fl oz; if not, make up to this amount with a little extra stock or white wine.
Heat a large frying pan and fry the bacon pieces on a medium-high heat for 3 minutes. Add the onion, cover with a lid and fry for a further 10 minutes until the onion is softened.

Meanwhile, prepare the pastry for the pie. On a lightly floured work surface, roll out each of the pastry sheets to about 3mm/⅛in thick. Cut each piece into long, thick ribbons, about 3cm/1¼in wide. You will need to make enough to cover the top of the dish, about 16 in total. Weave the ribbons together on a piece of baking paper, until you have a pastry top that is large enough to cover your pie. Chill in the fridge for 15 minutes to firm up or, if time allows, freeze until solid.
Take the filling out of the fridge and brush the edges of the dish with a little beaten egg. Carefully slide the pastry lattice from the baking paper and lay on top of the chilled filling. Trim the excess pastry around the rim and lightly press to seal.
Increase the oven temperature to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6. Brush the pastry with the remaining beaten egg and bake for 30 minutes until the pastry is golden and cooked through, and the chicken is bubbling. Serve hot.",,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/chicken_and_bacon_21897

Dissolve the sugar and salt in the hot water, then mix1 litre/1¾ pint cold water into the brine solution. Submerge the chicken and leave to stand, covered, for 2 hours. Meanwhile, make the sauces.
For the sweet soy sauce, put the soy, mirin, rice wine vinegar, ginger, garlic and sugar into a saucepan. Stir over a low heat until the sugar is dissolved and simmer for 2 minutes. Taste for seasoning and add a little salt if necessary. Add sesame oil to taste. Whisk the cornflour with a little cold water until you have a smooth but very runny paste, then whisk this into the sauce over a low heat, until the sauce thickens very slightly. Set aside.
For the chilli sauce, whisk all the ingredients together, thinning with a little water if too thick. Taste and add salt if necessary.
To cook the chicken, drain and rinse the brined chicken thoroughly, then pat dry. Make the first coating (this is the coating the batter will stick to, otherwise it tends to fall off) by whisking the flour, cornflour, baking powder and salt together. Dust the chicken in this mixture, patting off any excess, and leave to stand while you make the batter.
For the batter, whisk together the dry ingredients, then whisk in 100ml/3½ cold water and the vodka – the texture should be quite thin, like double cream.
Add oil to your fryer, large saucepan or wok, making sure you don’t fill it beyond half way. Heat the oil to 160C. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)
Dip the chicken pieces in the batter one at a time. Allow any excess to drip off over the bowl, then slowly lower into the hot oil, letting go when the chicken piece is almost submerged. Fry for 8–10 minutes, then drain and put on kitchen paper – the chicken should be cooked through but have barely taken on any colour. Turn the heat up to 190C, or if using a saucepan, turn the heat up and leave for around 5 minutes to reach the right temperature. Fry the chicken for another 2 minutes, or until it has darkened. Remove and drain thoroughly on kitchen paper. It should be beautifully crisp. You can serve it with the sauces, or you can brush some of the soy-based sauce over it and serve with the chilli sauce.",,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/korean_fried_chicken_51459

Line a large baking tin, around 30x25cm/12x10in, with two pieces of baking paper that cross over one another so it overhangs on every side. This will help to remove the baklava later.

Heat gently until the sugar and honey have melted and then simmer for around 10 minutes until the consistency is syrupy. Pour the syrup evenly over the pastry. Leave to cool completely, for at least an hour and preferably for a few hours if possible.
For the orange cream, put the cream in a large bowl with the orange zest. Whisk by hand or with an electric whisk until the cream is soft and billowy. Mix the icing sugar with the cardamom powder and stir this through the cream.
Remove the baklava from the tin and cut back through the scored lines, this time cutting through to the base. Use a metal dough scraper or a long knife so you can just press down instead of pulling through.

Cover with a lid and boil for one minute, stirring to dissolve the salt. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool.
Rinse the chickens thoroughly under cold running water. Add the chicken to the brine. (Ensure it’s submerged in the brine – you can do this with a plate, if necessary.) Chill in the fridge for six hours.
Preheat the oven to 240C/475°F/Gas 9.
Remove the chickens from the brine, rinse under cold running water and pat dry with kitchen paper.
Season the inside of each chicken with a light sprinkling of salt and freshly ground black pepper.
To truss the chickens, place one chicken on a tray with the legs towards you. Tuck the wing tips under the bird. Cut a 90cm/3ft piece of kitchen twine and place it on top of the neck end of the breast.
Lift the neck end of the bird and pull the twine down around the wings and under the chicken, then bring the ends up over the breast, towards you, and tie the twine into a knot, pulling it tight to plump the breast.
Bring the ends of the twine around the ends of the drumsticks and straight up. Tie as before to pull the drumsticks together and form a compact bird; tie again to secure the knot. Repeat the process with the second chicken. Let the chickens sit at room temperature for 20 to 30 minutes before roasting.
Season the outside of the chickens with a light sprinkling of salt and freshly ground black pepper.
Place two heavy-based, ovenproof frying pans over a high heat. When they are hot, add half the oil to each and heat until hot.
Put the chickens breast-side up into the pans, and then into the oven with the legs facing the back of the oven. Roast for 40 minutes, checking the birds every 15 minutes and rotating the griddle pans if the chickens are browning unevenly.
After 40 minutes, check the temperature of the birds by inserting a thermometer between the leg and the thigh. The temperature should read approximately 68C/155F. (The chicken will continue to cook as it sits, reaching a temperature of about 73C/165°F.)
When the birds are cooked, remove from the oven, add the thyme leaves to the pans, and baste the birds with the juices and thyme leaves. Set aside in a warm place for ten minutes.
To carve the chicken, cut the twine between the legs and pull on one end; the entire piece will pull away easily. Cut each bird into four pieces.
Remove each leg by cutting through the joint where the thigh joins the body. Slice off each side of the breast, leaving the wings attached to the breast meat; cut off and discard the wing tips.
For the chasseur jus, place the canola oil into a saucepan over a medium heat. Add the shallots, carrots, garlic cloves and button mushrooms. Fry until lightly coloured.
Add the tomato and stir until well combined. Pour in the wine and reduce the sauce until the liquid has almost evaporated.
Add the herbs and chicken stock. Bring to a simmer and skin the scum regularly for 30 minutes. Strain the sauce through a fine sieve and into a clean saucepan.
For the waffles, preheat a waffle maker to a medium setting and preheat the oven to 140C/275F/Gas 1. Place a large wire rack onto a baking sheet and keep it warm.
Mix the flour, baking powder, salt and granulated sugar in a large mixing bowl. Whisk in the eggs, milk and butter until well combined.
Ladle some of the batter into each well of the waffle maker and close the lid and cook for five minutes, or until golden-brown and crispy. Repeat the process until the batter is used up.
To serve, arrange one piece of breast and a leg on each serving plate and top with the sauce. Sprinkle with fleur de sel and place two waffles alongside. Serve with vanilla butter and maple syrup.",,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/roast_chicken_with_54406

Stir the warm milk slowly into the egg mixture. Pour the mixture back into the pan and cook over a low heat for 4-5 minutes, whisking, until the mixture thickens. (It should be very thick.)
Remove from the heat and beat in the butter until melted and incorporated. Transfer to a bowl, cover the surface with clingfilm to prevent a skin forming and leave to cool. Set aside to chill in the fridge.
For the jam, tip the raspberries into a deep saucepan with the sugar and two tablespoons of water. Cook gently over a low heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar is dissolved.

Sift the cornflour, flour and baking powder over the egg mixture and carefully fold in using a large metal spoon. Fold in the melted butter, taking care not to over mix.
Pour the mixture into the lined tin and bake for 25-30 minutes until the sponge is golden-brown and has just started to shrink away from the sides of the tin. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool. When cool enough to handle, turn out on to a wire rack to cool completely.
For the fondant rose, roll 10 little pieces of fondant into small balls about the size of a cherry stone.
Dust two small pieces of greaseproof paper with icing sugar and one by one, place the balls of fondant between the sheets of greaseproof and flatten each ball out with your fingers, to a thin circle, approximately 2cm/1in in diameter. These form the petals. Roll the first petal up like a sausage to form a bud and wrap the remaining petals around the bud to make a rose. Bend and curl the edges of the petals, to make them look more realistic. Leave to dry for at least an hour.
To assemble the cake, using a serrated knife, cut the cake horizontally into three even layers. Place one of the sponges onto a serving plate. Spread a very thin layer of custard over the base of the first sponge.
Spoon a quarter of the custard into a piping bag fitted with a small plain nozzle and pipe a border around the edge of the sponge – this is to contain the jam.

Season the lamb with freshly ground black pepper.
Place a piece of brik pastry on a clean work surface or chopping board and brush with the clarified butter.
Place one lamb fillet in the middle of the pastry sheet, spread half of the anchovy butter on the top, then put another fillet on top. Fold the pastry into a parcel, enclosing the lamb entirely.

Tie both parcels tightly with kitchen string. Place on a plate or tray and transfer to the fridge to rest for at least one hour.
To cook the lamb, preheat the vegetable oil in a deep fat fryer to 180C/350F. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous - do not leave unattended.) Carefully place the lamb parcels into the fat fryer, one at a time, and cook for 12-14 minutes, without turning as the pastry is very fragile. Remove the lamb from the fryer using a large slotted spoon, drain on kitchen paper and leave the lamb to rest in a warm place for five minutes.
For the artichokes, slice the artichokes finely and rub with the lemon juice. Heat a frying until hot, add the butter, olive oil, sliced artichokes and the garlic and fry for 2-3 minutes, or until tender. Add the chervil and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste.

Place in a bowl, season with salt and pepper and add the white wine, lemon zest and thyme leaves, then drizzle over the olive oil. Cover and leave to marinate for at least an hour.
For the pork layer, finely chop the pork shoulder and pork belly, or put the whole lot through a meat grinder, or blend in a food processor. Put into a bowl with the lemon zest, thyme leaves, ground ginger, apricots and pistachios and mix well. Season with salt and pepper.
Preheat the oven to 150C/130C Fan/Gas 2. Stretch the bacon rashers with the back of the knife. Line a 1 litre/1¾ pint terrine mould with the rashers, widthways, arranging them on alternative diagonals so that they overlap by slightly criss-crossing one another. You should have around 5cm/2in overlap on each side – if you don’t you may need to stretch the bacon out a little more.
Put half of the pork mixture into the terrine and spread it evenly. Remove the chicken from the marinade and mix with the finely chopped parsley in a bowl, then lay the strips out in an even layer. Finally, cover with the remaining pork mixture.
Cover the top of the terrine with the overhanging bacon slices, continuing with the criss-crossing, then top with more slices so that it is completely covered.
Put the lid on the terrine or cover with a double layer of foil. Put in a roasting tin and add just enough boiled water to reach up to 2cm/¾in up the side of the terrine. Put in the oven and bake for 1½ hours.
To check if the terrine is cooked through, check it has reached 75C (using a meat probe or thermometer) or just hold a skewer in the centre for a few seconds – if the tip is too hot to hold for more than a second, it is done.
Recover the terrine with a couple of layers of foil, then weigh down with either a couple of tins or something similarly heavy. Leave to cool, then leave to chill overnight in the fridge.

Hanetsuki gyoza,30,24 item(s),,"['250g/9oz pork mince', '4 garlic cloves, finely grated', '15g/½oz nira (also known as garlic chives), finely sliced', '80g/2¾oz Chinese cabbage (such as Napa cabbage), finely chopped', '½ tsp sea salt', '¼ tsp white pepper', '24 gyoza wrappers (see recipe tips)', '10g/⅓oz cornflour, plus extra for dusting', '10g/⅓oz plain flour', '1–2 tbsp vegetable oil, for frying', '4 tbsp dark soy sauce', '2 tbsp rice vinegar', '1 tsp chilli oil or sesame oil']","In a bowl, combine the pork mince, garlic, nira, Chinese cabbage, sea salt and white pepper.
To assemble the gyoza, have your gyoza wrappers and a bowl of cold water to hand, with the wrappers unwrapped, but covered loosely with a damp cloth or kitchen paper (if the wrappers dry out they are difficult to seal). Lightly dust a tray with cornflour.
Lay out a few wrappers at a time, dip your fingers in water and moisten their edges. Add a small spoonful of the pork mixture to the centre of each wrapper. Fold the wrappers over the filling and crimp one side while firmly pressing it onto the other side to seal. This will take some practice, but don’t worry if your crimping skills aren’t ‘gyoza master’ level. Some cooks don’t crimp at all, and un-crimped or awkwardly crimped gyoza still taste delicious. Keep the gyoza lined up on the dusted tray covered with damp kitchen paper while you make the remaining gyoza.
For the dipping sauce, stir all the ingredients together.
To cook the gyozas, prepare a starch slurry by stirring together the flours and 150ml/¼ pint cold water. It should resemble milk.
Add a little oil to a non-stick frying pan (see recipe tips) and use kitchen paper to wipe it around the surface so that only a thin film of oil remains (too much oil will cause the slurry to bubble, which makes it difficult to hold together). Heat the pan over a medium–high heat until it feels quite warm when you hold your hand above it. Add the gyoza, sealed-side up, in a sunflower/pinwheel pattern – you should be able to fit all the gyoza in the pan, but don’t worry if not, just make sure all the gyoza are snuggled up to each other, with no gaps between them, otherwise you’ll risk breaking the wings when you remove them from the pan.
Fry the gyoza for a minute. Give the cornflower liquid a good stir to mix in anything that might have settled to the bottom, then pour about 3–4 tablespoons of the liquid into the pan. The slurry should cover the bottom of the pan completely and surround all the gyoza. Immediately place a lid on the pan, turn the heat up to high and leave to steam for 3 minutes. Remove the lid and continue to cook until all the liquid has evaporated. When the pan is totally dry, a light, thin crust should have formed – you will be able to tell when it’s done because no part of it will still be bubbling and the crust will have curled away slightly from edges of pan.
To serve, it is best to have a plate that fits inside your frying pan so it can be rested on top of the gyoza in the pan. Lay the plate upsidedown on top of the gyoza, then carefully invert the pan and plate to turnout the gyoza. Serve with the dipping sauce.",,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/hanetsuki_gyoza_16067

To make the basil oil, heat the basil leaves and the olive oil in a saucepan. Heat to 80C/176F and then pour into a blender. Blend for three minutes. Pass through a sieve lined with muslin cloth and leave to drain. Reserve the oil.
For the ketchup sauce, in a small saucepan melt the butter and heat until nutty brown in colour (beurre noisette).
Pass the browned butter through a sieve into a clean pan and add the chopped fennel seeds, shallot and tomato ketchup. Cook gently for 20 minutes, stirring from time to time, until thick and then set aside in a warm place. The sauce will look split (the oil will separate out) which is fine.
To make the lime vinaigrette, whisk all ingredients together in a small bowl.
For the fennel salad slice the fennel thinly using a mandoline and place into iced water for an hour.
Strain the fennel and put it in a bowl, add the chopped dill and mix well.
Now season the lime vinaigrette with salt and pepper. Mix well.
For the fried red mullet, heat the oil in a non-stick pan. Season the fillets on the flesh side with salt and pepper and place into the hot pan skin-side down.
Press down using a fish slice and leave to fry for three minutes, then turn it over and fry on the other side for two minutes.
Transfer the fillets onto a baking tray lined with kitchen roll and season with a squeeze of lime juice.
To serve, place some Thai purée onto the serving plates and then swipe it down the middle of the plate. Spoon on the tomato sauce, taking both the sauce and oil. Place the fennel salad on top and place the fillet in the middle of the salad.
Garnish the plate with the micro basil leaves and drizzle some basil oil around the edge. Finish with a sprinkling of toasted fennel seeds.",,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/red_mullet_with_thai_05964

Add the oil and beaten egg and gradually incorporate the flour into the liquid. Start adding the water a little at a time until the mixture forms a slightly sticky (but not wet) and elastic dough, you may not need all the water depending on the size of the egg you are using. Bring the dough together with your hands. Put it on a plate, sprinkle with a little flour, cover with cling film and chill in the fridge for 30–60 minutes.
To make the filling, heat the oil in a frying pan and fry the onion until soft but not coloured, stirring regularly. Add the peppers and cook for 3 minutes, stirring, then add the scallops and fry for 30 seconds, stirring constantly.

Roll out the larger ball of pastry until it forms a circle about the size of a dinner plate and place it on the lightly oiled baking sheet. Spoon the cooled filling into the centre of the pastry and spread it out towards the edge, leaving a 2cm/1in border all the way around. Brush the border lightly with beaten egg.
Roll out the remaining pastry slightly smaller than the base of the pie and gently place it over the filling. Bring the base up to meet the smaller pastry disc and fold it over, pressing and crimping into a rope shape to make a sealed pastry edge.
Brush the pastry with beaten egg and make a couple of small slits in the top to allow the steam to escape.
Bake in the centre of the oven for 20–25 minutes until the pastry is golden brown and the filling is hot.

Meanwhile, use a little butter to grease the inside of a 23cm/9in square baking tin. Cut a square of baking parchment a bit bigger than your tin (roughly 27cm/11in). Snip a 5cm/2in cut diagonally from the corners toward the centre. Push the paper into the tin and ease the paper into the corners neatly - they will overlap slightly. Trim if needed.
Using a large sharp knife, chop the dark chocolate into small pieces (the smaller the pieces, the quicker it will melt). Place a medium saucepan containing an inch of boiling water from the kettle onto the hob and bring to a simmer. Place the chopped dark chocolate with the butter into a large mixing bowl.
Set the bowl over the pan of simmering water, making sure that the bottom of the bowl does not touch the water. Keep the heat low - the water should not be boiling furiously underneath, but quietly bubbling. After a few minutes the chocolate and butter will start to melt. Stir occasionally, until the chocolate is mostly melted. Remove the bowl from the pan and set aside. The residual heat in the chocolate will finish off the melting process.
While the chocolate is melting, chop the white (or white and milk) chocolate into bigger pieces - about the size of a penny. Set these aside.
Whisk the sugar into the melted chocolate, then add the eggs and whisk together well until the mix is slightly bubbly.
Sift the flour, cocoa powder and the salt into a separate bowl. Using a large metal spoon, add the flour mix into the chocolate mixture a third at a time, and gently fold into the chocolate mixture until thoroughly combined.
Gently pour the batter into the prepared tin, and scatter the remaining chunks of chocolate on top. Bake the brownies for 20-25 minutes. The brownies should still wobble slightly in the middle, as they will continue to cook for a little while when removed from the oven. An over-baked brownie is dry and crumbly, rather than moist and fudgy, so keep an eye on them.

Wrap the pastry in cling film and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
For the crème pâtissière, in a bowl, whisk the egg yolks and 20g/¾oz of the caster sugar together to a ribbon consistency. You may want to use an electric whisk to do this.
Gradually whisk in the flour until smooth and well combined.
In a saucepan, bring the milk, 40g/1½oz of the sugar and the vanilla pod to the boil. As soon as the mixture starts to boil, gradually pour the hot milk mixture onto the egg yolk mixture, stirring continuously.
Return the mixture to the pan and bring to the boil again, whisking continuously. Simmer for 1-2 minutes, then remove from the heat and transfer the mixture to a bowl.
Dust the crème pâtissière with a layer of icing sugar to prevent a skin from forming as it cools. (Once cool, the mixture can be kept in the fridge for up to three days. Remove the vanilla pod before using.)
Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.
Roll the rough puff pastry out onto a lightly floured surface to a 2mm/eighth of an inch thickness. Cut out six discs using a 12cm/5in pastry cutter.

Spread equal amounts of the crème pâtissière mixture evenly onto each of the pastry discs, leaving a narrow margin free at the edge of each pastry disc.
Arrange the apple slices in a fan on top of the crème pâtissière mixture, starting in the centre of each disc and working outwards to the edges.
Transfer the tartlets to the oven and bake for 15-18 minutes, or until the pastry has risen and is pale golden-brown. Sprinkle generously with the remaining 60g/2½oz of caster sugar, then return to the oven and cook for a further 4-5 minutes, or until the sugar has caramelised.

To make the pilau, you need a large saucepan with a lid – the dish will be made in one pot. Put the pan on a high heat and add the oil. As soon as the oil is hot, add the onion and salt, and cook until the onion is soft.
Now add the Quorn and fry it with the onions for a few minutes. Add 4 tablespoons of the jollof spice mix and stir well. If the spices start to stick to the base of the pan, add a small splash of water. Cook the spices for at least 10 minutes on a low heat.
Drain the rice in a sieve, making sure you remove all the water. Add the rice to the pan of onions and Quorn, and stir it in so it gets coated with all the delicious spices.
Boil a full kettle of water and have it at the ready. Pour boiling water on to the rice and keep going until the water is a couple of centimetres above the rice. I like to be accurate and even have a rice ruler to make sure.
Boil on a high heat, making sure to stir all the time. As soon as all the water has been absorbed, pop a lid on the pan and leave the rice to steam for 15 minutes on the lowest hob setting. When the rice is ready, fluff it up, using a fork.
Drain the cucumber in a colander and rinse with a little water to get rid of any excess salt. The cucumber and onion should be soft. Serve alongside the rice.",,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/jollof_quorn_pilau_with_33526

Roasted cherry tomatoes with baked ricotta and pizzette fritte,150,4 serving(s),,"['175g/6oz plain flour', '½ tsp salt', '100ml/3½fl oz warm water', '1 tbsp olive oil', '1 tsp fast-action dried yeast', 'flaky sea salt (optional)', 'dried oregano (optional)', 'olive oil, for shallow frying', 'olive oil, for brushing', '500g/1lb 2oz ricotta', '1 free-range egg, beaten', '2 tbsp finely grated Parmesan, plus optional extra to serve', 'small bunch soft herbs, such as oregano, marjoram or basil, finely chopped (or 1 tbsp dried oregano), reserve some for the pizzette', 'salt and freshly ground black pepper', '500g/1lb 2oz cherry tomatoes, halved (or use larger ones, quartered)', '1 tbsp olive oil', '4 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed', '1 tbsp runny honey', 'salt and freshly ground black pepper']","For the pizzette fritte, in a bowl, mix together the flour, salt, water, olive oil and the yeast to form a dough. Tip out onto an oiled worktop and knead for a good few minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic. Put the dough back in the bowl, cover with a cloth and leave somewhere warm to rise for 45-60 minutes, or until doubled in size.
Preheat the oven to 190C/ Fan 170C/ Gas 5. Brush olive oil over the base and sides of a baking dish large enough to hold the ricotta.
Mix the ricotta with the egg, Parmesan and half of the herbs. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
Spoon the mixture into the prepared dish, spread out in an even layer, and bake for about 30 minutes, or until puffed in the middle and browning in places. Remove from the oven and keep warm.
While the ricotta is baking, cook the roasted cherry tomatoes. Mix the tomatoes with a tablespoon of olive oil, the garlic and the honey and season with salt and pepper. Spread out in a snug-fitting oven dish and roast for about 40 minutes, or until juicy and bubbling. Remove from the oven, sprinkle over the rest of the herbs, and set aside somewhere warm.
Divide the dough into four equal-sized balls. Roll out each dough ball on an oiled worktop until you have four discs about 20cm/8in in diameter each.
Heat a large frying pan over a high heat until very hot. Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil and have some kitchen tongs at the ready. Use the tongs to carefully lower one of the dough discs into the hot oil, starting close to you and placing it away from you in case any of the oil splashes.
Use the kitchen tongs to press the centre of the dough down as it bubbles up and away from the pan. Cook the first pizzette for about 1 minute, or until golden-brown.
Use the kitchen tongs to carefully flip the dough and cook the other side for about 1 minute. Remove from the pan and set aside to drain on kitchen paper. Repeat the process with the rest of the dough discs. It’s nice to scatter the cooked fritte with extra salt and some dried oregano when they come out of the pan.
Serve the pizzette fritte with a large spoonful of the baked ricotta and tomato. Add an optional extra dusting of Parmesan if liked.",,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/roasted_cherry_tomatoes_66735

Rub the butter all over the bird and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Then lay the bacon rashers over the bird, more or less covering it completely. The job of the bacon is twofold: to help keep the breast basted without you having to open (and therefore cool) the oven every ten minutes; and to buy you time, so the skin doesn't burn before the breast is cooked through.
Place the bird in a roasting tray in the centre of the oven. Cook on this high heat for 25-30 minutes until the bacon is almost burnt.
Remove the bacon from the breast of the bird and put on one side. Baste the breast of the bird with the fat and juices in the pan and return to the oven. Turn down the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4 and continue to cook for about 12 minutes per 1kg/2¼lb, protecting the skin with buttered foil only if it seems to need it. Cook until the juices run clear when the thickest part of the breast is pierced with a skewer and the skin is brown and crispy. Cooked like this even a big bird (say 6-7kg/13½-15¾lb legless weight) shouldn't take more than 1½-2 hours in total.
Serve slices of roast turkey breast and spoonfuls of the leg meat in their rich gravy, with all the usual trimmings: roast potatoes, bread sauce, steamed sprouts, chipolatas wrapped in bacon and stuffing.",,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/roastleglessturkey_13963

Bake the cakes, a couple at a time, in the pre-heated oven for about 8-10 minutes until pale golden and springy to the touch. With a sharp knife, trim the circles. Peel off the parchment and leave to cool on a wire rack.
To make the almond praline and caramel coated hazelnuts, spread the flaked almonds over a sheet of baking parchment on a baking tray.
Stick cocktail sticks into each of the 16 hazelnuts.
Dissolve the sugar in 8 tbsp water over a low heat, stirring constantly, then increase the heat and boil the syrup until it turns a deep golden-brown colour. Allow it to cool slightly then pour half of it over the flaked almonds. Set aside to cool completely.
Dip the hazelnuts in the hot caramel twisting the cocktail sticks so the nuts are completely coated in caramel. Carefully invert the cocktail sticks and press them into an orange or piece of foam and leave to set.
Take one of the 15cm/6in sponge circles and place it on a sheet of silicon or baking parchment. Pour the remaining caramel over the sponge circle.
When the caramel on top of the sponge is just beginning to set, mark and then cut into eight portions with an oiled knife.
Sandwich the six circles of 20cm/8in sponges together with caramel buttercream. Spread the sides and top with buttercream.
Sandwich the remaining five circles of 15cm/6in sponges together with butter cream. Spread buttercream around the sides and top of the cakes and place on top the 20cm/8in cake stack to form a second tier.
Break the almond praline into small pieces and press into the sides of both tiers of the cake.
Spoon the remaining buttercream into a piping bag fitted with a medium size star nozzle. Pipe 16 rosettes of the buttercream around the top edge of the larger cake and top each rosette with a caramel coated hazelnut.

The ultimate Christmas roast beef,120,8 serving(s),https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/food/ic/food_16x9_832/recipes/the_ultimate_christmas_34876_16x9.jpg,"['225g/8oz plain flour', '8 free-range eggs', '600ml/20fl oz milk', 'sea salt and freshly ground black pepper', '1 cauliflower, cut into large florets', '300g/10½oz French beans, trimmed', '1 broccoli, cut into large florets', '8 carrots, peeled and cut into batons', '2.75kg/6lb 2oz whole beef sirloin, fat and sinew trimmed', '250g/9oz beef dripping or lard', '200ml/7fl oz red wine', '1 litre/1¾ pints beef stock', '2kg/4lb 8oz large floury potatoes such as King Edward, each peeled and cut into 2 or 3 pieces', '200g/7oz smoked streaky bacon slices, cut into lardons', '500g/1lb 2oz Brussels sprouts, trimmed and finely shredded', '250g/9oz cooked chestnuts, roughly chopped', '175g/6oz butter']","First prepare the Yorkshire pudding batter. Pour the flour into a large mixing bowl. Make a well in the centre, then whisk in the eggs one at a time, bringing in the flour from the insides of the well as you do so.
Gradually whisk in the milk until the batter is smooth and well combined. Season with salt and pepper, then cover the bowl and chill in the fridge overnight.
You can also prepare the vegetables a day in advance. Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil. Prepare a large bowl of iced water. Add the cauliflower florets to the boiling water and boil for 4-5 minutes, or until perfectly tender. Remove from the pan using a slotted spoon and plunge into the bowl of iced water. Set aside until the florets have cooled (this will prevent them from continuing to cook). Drain, transfer to a roasting tray and set aside.
Repeat the process with the French beans, simmering them for just 2-3 minutes. Add the drained, cooled beans to the tray.
Repeat the process with the broccoli florets, simmering them for 1-2 minutes. Add the drained, cooled broccoli to the tray.
Repeat the process with the carrot batons, simmering them for 6-7 minutes. Add the drained, cooled carrot to the tray.
This will ensure you have all the vegetables prepared and perfectly cooked ready to reheat on the day. Chill all of the vegetables, covered, in the roasting tray (or in a re-sealable food bag or plastic container) until needed.
On Christmas Day, prepare the beef. Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.
Score the fat of the beef in a criss-cross pattern using a sharp knife, then season the beef generously with salt and pepper.
Heat a frying pan over a high heat. When the pan is very hot, add 25g/1oz of the beef dripping and, when it has melted, fry the beef on all sides until browned all over.
Place the beef joint, fat side facing downwards, into a roasting tray and roast for 45-50 minutes (for medium-rare) or longer until cooked to your liking – although bear in mind that the meat will continue to cook as it rests. Turn the beef joint halfway through the cooking time. When the beef is cooked to your liking, transfer it to a large plate, cover with aluminium foil and set aside to rest for 30 minutes.
Meanwhile for the gravy, return the frying pan containing the meat juices to a medium heat and, when it is hot, add the wine. Bring the mixture to a simmer and continue to simmer until the volume of liquid has reduced by half.
Add the beef stock and return the mixture to a simmer, simmering until the volume of liquid has reduced by one-third, then season with salt and pepper. Strain the gravy into a jug or gravy boat. Cover and keep warm until needed (you may need to reheat it before serving).
Next, make the roast potatoes. Place the potatoes into a large saucepan, cover with cold water, add a pinch of salt and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat until the water is simmering and simmer the potatoes for 3-4 minutes. Drain the potatoes using a colander and shake them around a little in the colander to roughen the edges. Set aside.
When the beef has only 35 minutes left to cook, put 100g/3½oz of the remaining beef dripping or lard into a deep-sided roasting tray. Heat the fat in the oven for 5 minutes, or until smoking hot.
Carefully add the cooked, drained potatoes to the hot fat, making sure you keep your face as far away from the roasting tray as possible in case the fat spits. Season the potatoes with sea salt, then return the roasting tray to the oven. Roast the potatoes with the beef for 30 minutes, or until they are starting to turn golden-brown and crisp.
Turn the potatoes over after you remove the beef from the oven, then increase the oven temperature to 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7 and roast the potatoes for a further 30 minutes.
As soon as you have turned the potatoes over, divide 100g/3¾oz of the remaining dripping or lard equally among the holes of two 12-hole muffin tins or Yorkshire pudding tins. Heat the fat in the oven for 10 minutes, or until smoking hot.
Meanwhile, transfer the Yorkshire pudding batter to a jug. Carefully pour the Yorkshire pudding batter into the tins, filling each hole two-thirds full. Bake the Yorkshire puddings in the oven with the roast potatoes for the final 20 minutes that the potatoes should have left to cook, making sure you do not reopen the oven door.
After 20 minutes, open the oven door slightly to allow any steam to escape. Remove the potatoes, which should be ready now (prick them with a sharp knife to check they are tender in the middle). Transfer to a serving dish and keep warm.
Reduce the oven temperature to 190C/170C Fan/Gas 5. Continue to cook the Yorkshire puddings at this temperature for a further 12-15 minutes, or until crisp, risen and golden-brown. Transfer to a serving dish and keep warm.
For the Brussels sprouts, heat the remaining dripping or lard in a large frying pan over a medium heat. Add the bacon and fry for 3-4 minutes, or until crisp and golden-brown.
Add the sprouts and stir-fry for 2-3 minutes, or until just wilted. Add the chopped chestnuts, half of the butter and 2 tablespoons of water, then stir-fry until the chestnuts have heated through and the liquid has evaporated. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from the heat and keep warm.
Finally, bring a large saucepan of salted water to the boil, add all of the blanched vegetables and simmer for 30 seconds, or until heated through. Drain well and transfer to a serving platter, dotted with the remaining butter.
Serve the beef on a platter, surrounded by the roast potatoes on one side and the Brussels sprouts on the other. Serve the vegetables on a separate platter and the sauce in a gravy boat.",,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/the_ultimate_christmas_34876

Suspend a heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water, making sure the base of the bowl does not touch the water. Add the chocolate and butter and stir until smooth and melted.
Remove the bowl from the heat, then beat in the sugar until well combined (it will look slightly lumpy, but don’t worry).
Beat in each egg, one at a time, until well combined, then stir in the vanilla extract and fold in the flour. Pour the brownie mixture into the slow cooker.
In the same bowl, mix the cream cheese with the condensed milk (it might look almost curdled, but again, don’t worry). Drop teaspoonfuls of the cream cheese mixture on top of the brownie mixture, one at a time, swirling each through the mixture using a skewer to create a marbled effect. (Don’t mix in the cream cheese completely.)
Put the lid onto the slow cooker and cook the brownies on a high heat for 2-2½ hours, testing them after 2 hours by inserting a skewer into the centre - if the skewer comes out clean, and the top of the brownies look cooked (see tip), the brownies are ready.
Lift the brownies out of the slow cooker using the paper lining to help you and transfer to a wire rack to cool. Do not try to peel the greaseproof paper from the brownies until they have completely cooled.

Put the potatoes into a saucepan and cover with cold water. Add a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil. Simmer for 5 minutes, then drain and leave to dry out for a minute.
Put the duck fat (or oil) in a large roasting tin and heat in the oven until smoking. Add the potatoes and shake the tin so that the potatoes get well coated with the fat or oil. Season with plenty of salt and pepper.
Crush the garlic cloves, leaving their skins on, then add to the tin along with the rosemary. Roast in the oven for around 30 minutes, checking and turning over every so often until the potatoes are crisp and brown around the edges. The garlic may cook through sooner, in which case, remove it and set aside until the potatoes are cooked.
To make the sauce, put the sugar and 50ml/2fl oz of water in a saucepan and cook on a low heat, stirring regularly, until the sugar has dissolved. Add the kumquats and simmer for around 5 minutes until the kumquats are tender. Remove the kumquats from the syrup and set aside.
Turn up the heat and boil the syrup until it turns the colour of caramel. Add the red wine, red wine vinegar, shallots and star anise and return to the boil. Simmer until the volume of the liquid has reduced by half, then add the orange juice and chicken stock.
Again, simmer until the volume of the sauce has reduced by half. The sauce should be rich and syrupy. Taste for seasoning and add plenty of black pepper and salt if necessary. Return the kumquats to the sauce and set aside.
For the duck, score a criss-cross pattern through the skin and fat of the duck breasts, stopping just short of the flesh. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Heat the oil (or duck fat) in a large oven-proof frying pan. When close to smoking point, add the duck breasts, skin-side down and fry until the skin is a rich golden brown and a great deal of fat has rendered out – around 6–7 minutes. Flip over and sear for a further 4 minutes. Remove from the pan and leave to rest.
Strain off most of the fat from the frying pan, then pour it in the sauce. Deglaze the pan and add back any juices which may have collected under the strained off fat. Finally add any juices from the resting duck.

Melt the sugar in a fairly wide saucepan, being careful not to stir but just swirling it around once in a while, until the sugar has melted and turned a light caramel colour. Remove from the heat and add the butter.
The liquid will bubble up, then subside, and you can then whisk the butter in. If the caramel splits, you can add a tablespoon of warm water and re-whisk – the sauce should re-emulsify.
Pour the caramel over the tarte tatin dish or skillet, then sprinkle in the cardamom and orange zest, if using. Arrange the bananas cut-side up over the caramel – they should be quite a snug fit.
Roll out the puff pastry into a round – or you can just roll it out and trim it to a round. Prick it lightly all over with a fork, then place on top of the bananas, tucking the edges in as you go. Bake for between 40–45 minutes, or until the pastry is a rich golden-brown. It may be slightly risen.

Tie the bunches of coriander and parsley together using cook's string to make a small bouquet. Place it on top on the meat.
Add the cinnamon sticks and 750ml/1¼ pints water to the tagine, then bring the mixture to a gentle simmer. Cover the tagine or casserole with the lid and continue to simmer for 2 hours, turning the pieces of meat after 1 hour and topping up with more water during cooking, as necessary.

Cover with clingfilm and leave to soak for three days, stirring daily.
Grease and line a 23cm/9in deep, round tin with a double layer of greased greaseproof paper. Preheat the oven to 140C/120C Fan/Gas 1.
Measure the butter, sugar, eggs, treacle and almonds into a very large bowl and beat well (preferably with an electric free-standing mixer). Add the flour and ground spice and mix thoroughly until blended. Stir in the soaked fruit. Spoon into the prepared cake tin and level the surface.
Bake in the centre of the preheated oven for about 4-4½ hours, or until the cake feels firm to the touch and is a rich golden brown. Check after two hours, and if the cake is a perfect colour, cover with foil. A skewer inserted into the centre of the cake should come out clean. Leave the cake to cool in the tin.
When cool, pierce the cake at intervals with a fine skewer and feed with a little extra brandy. Wrap the completely cold cake in a double layer of greaseproof paper and again in foil and store in a cool place for up to three months, feeding at intervals with more brandy. (Don’t remove the lining paper when storing as this helps to keep the cake moist.)
The week before you want to serve, begin covering the cake.
For the covering, stand the cake upside down, flat side uppermost, on a cake board which is 5cm/2in larger than the size of the cake.
Brush the sides and the top of the cake with the warm apricot jam.
Liberally dust a work surface with icing sugar and then roll out the marzipan to about 5cm/2in larger than the surface of the cake. Keep moving the marzipan as you roll, checking that it is not sticking to the work surface. Dust the work surface with more icing sugar as necessary.
Carefully lift the marzipan over the cake using a rolling pin. Gently level and smooth the top of the paste with the rolling pin, then ease the marzipan down the sides of the cake, smoothing it at the same time. If you are careful, you should be able to cover the cake with no excess marzipan to trim but, if necessary, neatly trim excess marzipan from the base of the cake with a small sharp knife. Cover the cake loosely with baking parchment and leave for a few days to dry out before adding the royal icing.
For the royal icing, whisk the egg whites in a large bowl until they become frothy. Mix in the sifted icing sugar a tablespoonful at a time. You can do this with a hand-held electric whisk, but keep the speed low.
Stir in the lemon juice and glycerine and beat the icing until it is very stiff and white and stands up in peaks.
Cover the surface of the icing tightly with clingfilm and keep in a cool place until needed.
To ice the cake, place all the icing onto the top of the cake. Spread evenly over the top and sides of the cake with a palette knife. For a snow-peak effect, use a smaller palette knife to rough up the icing.
Leave the cake loosely covered overnight for the icing to harden a little, then wrap or store in an airtight container in a cool place until needed.",,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/classic_christmas_cake_04076

Heat enough oil to just cover the bottom of a large frying pan over a medium–high heat until shimmering. Line a warmed plate with a couple of sheets of kitchen paper.
Spoon some of the cabbage mixture into the pan into pancake shapes that are about the size of your palm. Press down with the back of the spoon and fry until golden-brown on each side, flipping halfway. Transfer the pancakes to the kitchen paper to drain.
Fry in batches until you’ve run out of mixture – you should get about eight pancakes.
Serve the pancakes drizzled with the okonomiyaki sauce.",,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/easy_okonomiyaki_78828

Baked aloo gobi with flatbreads,30,4 serving(s),https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/food/ic/food_16x9_832/recipes/baked_aloo_gobi_with_32681_16x9.jpg,"['1 large cauliflower, left whole', '4 tbsp coconut oil', '2.5cm/1in piece fresh root ginger, peeled and grated', '4 green chillies, finely chopped and seeds removed', '4 garlic cloves, crushed', '1 tbsp black mustard seeds', '2 tsp ground turmeric', '400ml tin coconut milk', '1 unwaxed lemon, halved', '600g/1lb 5oz potatoes, scrubbed, skin left on and cut into 2cm/¾in pieces', 'salt and freshly ground black pepper', '50g/1¾oz Greek-style yoghurt (or a thick dairy-free alternative), to serve', '25g/1oz blanched almonds, to serve', 'coriander leaves, to serve', '200g/7oz plain flour, plus extra for dusting', '1 tsp baking powder', '200g/7oz Greek-style yoghurt or 150ml/5fl oz warm water']","For the aloo gobi, using a sharp pair of kitchen scissors, cut the large leaves and stalks away from the outside of the cauliflower. You can leave the smaller leaves close to the florets – they will go nice and crispy when roasted. Turn the cauliflower upside down and, using a small paring knife, carefully cut a hollow in the middle of the central stalk to help the cauliflower cook evenly. Take a casserole or lidded saucepan and half-fill it with water from the kettle and bring to the boil. Add salt to the pan, add the cauliflower, cover and simmer for 6 minutes. Drain the cauliflower and return to the pan off the heat, put the lid back on and leave the cauliflower to steam for 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, take another casserole dish and place over a medium heat. Heat the coconut oil , then add the ginger, chillies and garlic and cook for a few minutes, until fragrant. Stir in the mustard seeds and continue cooking until the garlic has softened. Add the turmeric and a big pinch of salt.
Preheat the oven to 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7.
Pour the coconut milk into the casserole dish, stir well and season with a little pepper. Place the steamed cauliflower in a colander to drain off any water. When the milk starts to bubble gently, turn off the heat and place the cauliflower in the dish, then baste it with the coconut-spice mixture. Add the lemon halves to the dish and scatter the potatoes around the cauliflower so they sit in the coconut milk.
Bake in the oven, basting the cauliflower occasionally with the sauce in the dish, for 40–45 minutes. You want it to catch a little on top. To test if the cauliflower is cooked, insert a small sharp knife into the middle – it should be really tender and the potatoes and cauliflower should have soaked up most of the sauce. Carefully remove the lemons and leave to cool slightly before squeezing them over the aloo gobi. Transfer the aloo gobi to a serving dish.
While the aloo gobi is baking, prepare the flatbreads. Place the flour, baking powder and yoghurt in the bowl of a food processor and pulse until the mixture forms a ball. If you don’t have a food processor, this can be done in a bowl using a fork to begin with, followed by your hands.
Tip the dough out on a clean work surface that is lightly dusted with flour. Knead for a minute or two. Put the dough into a flour-dusted bowl and cover with a plate. Leave to rise for 10–15 minutes. It won’t rise like normal dough, but it may puff up slightly.
Dust a clean work surface and rolling pin with flour and divide the dough into four equal pieces. Using your hands, pat and flatten out the dough and then use the rolling pin to roll each piece into a circle that is roughly 20cm/8in in diameter and 2–3mm thick.
Place a large frying pan or griddle pan that is slightly larger than your flatbreads over a medium heat. Once hot, cook each flatbread for 1–2 minutes on each side, turning with tongs, until nicely puffed up.

Pour in the wine and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat slightly until the wine is just simmering, then cook until two-thirds of the wine has evaporated.
Add a ladleful of the warm stock to the pan and return to a simmer, reducing the heat if the liquid starts to bubble too fiercely, to prevent the rice from cooking too quickly.

Add the eggs and beat for several minutes. Reduce speed and mix in the flour.
Turn out onto a piece of floured greaseproof paper, flatten into a round wrap and chill. This pastry needs to be chilled for at least 1 hour otherwise it is difficult to handle.

Sizzling rice prawns with curried celery,60,4 serving(s),,"['225g/8oz long grain rice', '2-3 tsp groundnut oil, plus 1.2 litres/2 pints groundnut oil for deep-frying', '450g/1lb raw prawns, peeled', '2 tbsp groundnut oil', '1 tsp finely chopped fresh ginger', '1½ tsp finely chopped garlic', '3 tbsp finely chopped spring onions', '100g/4oz green or red pepper, diced', '1 tbsp cider vinegar or Chinese black rice vinegar', '1 tbsp dark soy sauce', '2 tbsp light soy sauce', '1½ tbsp chilli bean sauce', '1½ tbsp tomato purée', '2 tbsp Shaoxing rice wine or dry sherry', '2 tsp sugar', '300ml/10½ fl oz chicken stock', '1 tbsp cornflour blended with 2 tbsp water to form a smooth paste', '1 tbsp sesame oil', '450g/1lb celery', '1 tbsp groundnut or vegetable oil', '2 tbsp garlic, coarsely chopped', '2 tsp finely chopped fresh ginger', '1 tbsp Shaoxing rice wine or dry sherry', '2 tsp Madras curry powder', '1 tsp light soy sauce', '2 tsp sugar', '½ tsp salt', 'freshly ground black pepper, to taste', '2 tbsp finely chopped spring onions, to garnish', '1 tbsp finely chopped fresh coriander, to garnish']","To make the rice cake, wash the rice and put it into a 24cm/9in wide, heavy-based saucepan with 600ml/1 pint water. Bring to the boil over a high heat, then turn the heat down as low as possible, cover and cook for about 45 minutes. The rice should form a heavy crust on the bottom, but not burn. Remove all the loose rice - it can be used for making fried rice.
Drizzle the two teaspoons of oil evenly on top of the rice crust and let it cook over a very low heat for about five minutes. The crust should now lift off easily. If it's sticky, add another teaspoon of oil and continue to cook until it becomes loose. Place on a plate and put to one side. Once cooled and dried, break into small pieces.
For the prawns, use a small, sharp knife to split each prawn open lengthways, leaving it still attached at the back. Open the prawns out so that they splay open into a butterfly shape. Wash the prawns and dry them.
Heat a wok until it is very hot and then add the two tablespoons of groundnut oil. When the oil is very hot and lightly smoking, add the ginger and stir-fry it quickly for a few seconds, then add the garlic and spring onions.
After a few seconds add the prawns and stir-fry them quickly until they become firm.
Add all the sauce ingredients, except the cornflour paste and sesame oil, and bring to the boil. Remove from the heat and stir in the cornflour paste.
Return to the heat and bring back to the boil. Stir in the sesame oil and then reduce the heat to a very gentle simmer. Keep hot until ready to serve.
For the curried celery, trim the base of the celery and all the top leaves. Separate the stalks. With a small sharp knife remove the strings from the tough stalks. Chop the stalks into 2.5cm/1in sections.
Heat a wok or large frying-pan over high heat until it is hot. Add the oil, and when it is very hot and slightly smoking, add the garlic and ginger and stir-fry for 10 seconds. Add the celery and continue to stir-fry for one minute.
Add the rice wine, curry powder, soy sauce, sugar, salt and pepper and continue to stir-fry another minute. Then add three tablespoons of water and continue to cook over high heat for 3-4 minutes until just tender. When ready to serve, sprinkle the mixture with the spring onions and fresh coriander, mix well, pour unto a platter.
Meanwhile, to finish the rice cakes, heat the groundnut oil in a wok or deep-fat fryer until it is very hot (CAUTION: Hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended).
Drop a small piece of the dried rice cake into the oil to test the temperature - it should bubble all over and immediately come up to the surface.
When the oil is hot enough, deep-fry the pieces of rice cake for about 1-2 minutes or until they puff up and brown slightly.
Remove them immediately with a slotted spoon and drain them on a plate lined with kitchen paper.
Quickly transfer the pieces of hot rice cake to a warm platter and pour the hot prawns over them, taking care as it may splatter. It should sizzle dramatically. Serve at once with the dish of curried celery alongside.",,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/sizzlingriceprawns_79924

Add the yeast. Mix the honey with the oil and water, then pour this over the flour.
Mix until you have a sticky dough, then turn out the dough and knead until soft and passes the windowpane test (stretch a small piece out until you can see through it – gluten is developed enough if it allows you do this). Return to the bowl and cover with a damp tea towel. Leave to double in size – at least an hour.
Meanwhile make the topping. Heat the olive oil and butter in a very large frying pan. When the butter has melted and is foaming, add the onions and thyme leaves (if using). Season with salt. Stir carefully until they reduce in volume – there will seem almost too much for the pan to start with, but they will collapse quite quickly. Continue to cook on a low to medium heat for at least 45 minutes to an hour, stirring regularly. The onions will lightly caramelise on the base – scrape this up regularly when you stir.
Eventually you will have very soft, almost puréed, golden brown onions. You can instead cover the pan and let the onions sweat for a similar amount of time – they will collapse in a similar way but be lighter in colour.
Preheat the oven to 230C/210C Fan/Gas 8.
Knock the dough back and shape to fill a large baking tray – around 40x20cm/16x8in. Spread the onions over the dough, leaving a narrow border, then add the anchovies in a lattice pattern – or more free-form if you prefer (I often do a small amount without as there’s always someone who doesn’t like anchovies!). Add the olives at intervals. Drizzle with a little more olive oil, if you like. Bake in the preheated oven for around 20-25 minutes, or until the dough is cooked through.

Peruvian-style suckling pig,120,12 serving(s),,"['1 x 5-7kg/11-15½lb suckling pig', '120ml/4fl oz orange juice', '120ml/4fl oz Peruvian-style chilli sauce (available from online specialists)', '120ml/4fl oz pisco (brandy), preferably Peruvian', '120ml/4fl oz purple maize juice (called chicha morada, available from online specialists)', '8 garlic cloves, crushed', '1 tbsp ground cumin', 'salt and freshly ground black pepper', 'quinoa, stir-fried vegetables, fried cassava and roasted sweet potatoes, to serve (serving suggestions only)']","For the marinade, mix together all of the marinade ingredients in a large bowl until well combined.
Using a sharp, thin-bladed knife, pierce holes all over the skin of the suckling pig, about 5cm/2in apart.
Place one bin-bag-sized food bag inside another, then place the suckling pig into the bags and pour in the marinade. Shake the bag to cover the pig in the marinade. Squeeze out as much air from the bags as possible, secure tightly, then set aside in the fridge to marinate for 24 hours, turning the suckling pig after 12 hours.
Once the suckling pig has marinated, remove it from the fridge and set aside at room temperature for 6 hours.
When the suckling pig has returned to room temperature, preheat the oven to 190C/170C Fan/Gas 5.
Remove the suckling pig from the bags and transfer it to a large roasting tray. Wrap the head, trotters and tail in aluminium foil, then roast in the oven for 15 minutes, or until the skin is golden-brown.
Reduce the oven temperature to 150C/130C Fan/Gas 2 and continue to roast the suckling pig for 3 hours (for a 5kg/11lb pig) and 4 hours (for an 8kg/15½lb pig). Check the suckling pig every 30 minutes or so to make sure that the skin is not burning, basting it with the roasting juices each time. (If the skin is browning too quickly, reduce the oven temperature by 10 degrees or so.) For the last 30 minutes of cooking time, remove the foil from the pig to brown the head, trotters and tail.
Remove the suckling pig from the oven and pour the roasting juices into a saucepan. Set the pig aside to rest for at least 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat the roasting juices over a medium heat. In a small bowl, whisk together 1 tablespoon of cornflour and enough water to form a thick paste with the consistency of double cream. Add the mixture to the roasting juices to thicken them. If they thicken too much, thin with more boiling water if necessary. Stir the ingredients together for 10 minutes, or until the gravy is smooth and has thickened.
To serve, carve the suckling pig at the table, and place the slices onto serving plates. Drizzle over the gravy. Serve with Peruvian-style vegetables and grains, such as quinoa, stir-fried vegetables, fried cassava or roast sweet potato.",,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/peruvian-style_suckling_45466
Shallot tarte tatin with whipped goats' cheese and watercress,60,4 serving(s),,"['10 banana shallots, cut into round circles about a 1cm/½in thick', '2 tbsp olive oil', '50g/1¾oz butter', '50ml/2fl oz sherry vinegar', '50ml/2fl oz dry Madeira', '100ml/3½fl oz chicken stock', '20g/¾oz fresh thyme, leaves picked', '500g/1lb 2oz ready-made all-butter puff pastry', 'plain flour, for dusting', 'sea salt and white pepper', '100g/3½oz caster sugar', '1 tbsp balsamic vinegar', '45g/1½oz butter, chilled and cut into cubes', '200g/7oz goats’ cheese, preferably Dorstone or Tymsborough goats’ cheese, at room temperature, cut into small pieces', '200ml/7fl oz single cream', '1 unwaxed lemon, zest and juice only', '1 bunch fresh watercress', '50ml/2fl oz extra virgin olive oil', '50g/1¾oz chives, snipped']","Season the shallots lightly with salt and white pepper. Heat a large frying pan over a medium heat. Add the oil and the butter and cook until foaming. Add the shallots and cook until caramelised.
Drain off the butter and return the shallots to the heat. Add the vinegar and cook until it has evaporated. Add the Madeira and cook until it too has evaporated.
Add a little chicken stock, reduce to a simmer and place some parchment on top. Gently cook until the shallots are getting a little soft. Remove from the heat and leave to rest and suck up all the flavours.
For the balsamic caramel, put the sugar in a saucepan. Add a little water and stir so it’s like a paste. Slowly bring to the boil (CAUTION: boiling sugar is extremely hot. Handle very carefully.). The liquid will boil clear and very slowly it will start to turn amber.
When the sugar syrup is golden, remove from the heat and at arm’s length add the balsamic. Leave for a few moments, then whisk in the butter until the sauce has a butterscotch consistency. Season with salt and pepper and taste; it may take a little more balsamic to cut the sweetness and a little more seasoning. Set aside.
For the whipped goats’ cheese, put the cheese in a food processor with the paddle attachment and turn the processor on to slow. Add a little cream just to lighten the consistency (you may not need it all). Add a little lemon juice to taste (reserve the zest for garnish). Spoon into a bowl and cover with cling film, then set aside.
Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.
Spoon the caramel into four blini pans to lightly cover the bottom of each pan. Add some thyme to each pan, then add the shallots.
Roll the pastry on a lightly floured surface to 3mm thick and cut out four circles just larger than the blini pans. Place the pastry over the shallots and, using the end of a spoon, push it into them all the way around. Make a small hole in the middle. Bake for 20–30 minutes, or until cooked through.
Leave the tarts for 10 minutes to soak up all that wonderful flavour. While they are still warm, turn them out onto a plate and serve with a spoon of the goats’ cheese in the middle of each tart.

Smoked aubergines with garlic (mirza ghasemi),30,4 serving(s),https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/food/ic/food_16x9_832/recipes/smoked_aubergines_with_49362_16x9.jpg,"['3 large aubergines', 'vegetable or olive oil, for frying', '1 bulb garlic, cloves peeled and thinly sliced', '½ tsp turmeric', '3 large ripe tomatoes, quartered', '2 tbsp tomato purée', '½ tsp caster sugar', '1½ tsp crushed sea salt', '2 large free-range eggs, beaten', 'small handful of broken walnut pieces, to garnish', 'Persian flatbread, to serve']","The most authentic way to prepare the aubergines is to blister them whole over an open flame (either on a barbecue or over a domestic gas hob) until blackened and the flesh has softened right through to the centre. Alternatively, to bake them, preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7. Place the aubergines in a roasting tin and roast them whole in the oven 40-45 minutes.
Meanwhile put a good drizzle of oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat and slowly cook the garlic slices, ensuring you cook them through rather than simply browning them. If they start to go brown too quickly, take the pan off the heat and allow the residual heat to cook them through, if necessary. Once the garlic begins to brown around the edges, stir in the turmeric. Add the tomatoes to the pan and cook for about 15-20 minutes, or until they break down and are cooked through, then turn off the heat and set the pan aside.
Once the aubergines are cooked, score the aubergine skin from stalk to base and scoop out the flesh using a large spoon. Stir this into the garlic and tomatoes. Place the pan over a medium-high heat and cook through for a few minutes, mashing a little as you go. Lastly, add the tomato purée, sugar and sea salt, stir well and cook for a further 6-8 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent the mixture from browning.
Make lots of little holes in the aubergine mixture and pour the beaten eggs straight into the pan, but do not stir in the egg. You want to ensure the eggs are cooking and solidifying before you incorporate them, they take about 5-6 minutes to become opaque. Once cooked, give the mixture one final stir and remove the pan from the heat. Leave the mixture to cool for 20 minutes, as this dish is best served warm rather than piping hot.

Place the flours, bicarbonate of soda and salt into a large bowl and stir together. Make a large hole in the centre of the flour mixture and pour in the melted butter and treacle, plus enough of the buttermilk to make a loose sticky dough.
Tip the dough onto a lightly dusted work surface. The dough will be quite sticky. Knead the dough for one minute, then shape it into a large ball with a taut, smooth top. Place the dough on a baking tray and flatten it a bit - I find the easiest way to do this is with a rolling pin.
Take a wooden spoon, put some flour over the whole handle, then hold it horizontally over the bread. Put the wooden spoon handle on top of the bread then push it down until you feel the baking tray at the bottom. This mark is the first half of the trademark soda bread cross. Repeat with a line at right angles to this.
Dust with some flour then bake in the oven for 30–40 minutes, or until the bread is brown, has risen nicely and the dough inside where the cross was made is not damp.
Serve fresh from the oven with butter and jam. This bread does not keep well, so is best eaten on the day that it is baked – but if you have any left, it does make good toast.",,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/soda_bread_41394

Fold in the flour, adding enough to make a soft dough. Wrap the dough in cling film and chill it in the fridge for about 30 minutes. This makes it easier to roll out.

Place a thin layer of filling over the pastry spreading it out as far as the edges of the plate or board underneath. Don’t overdo the filling – a little goes a long way.
Fold the edges of the pastry in towards the middle to form a nice pleated curly pie. Don’t worry if it looks a bit rustic – the folds make the curls in your curly pie. Repeat to make the remaining pies in the same way and place them on a baking tray.
Beat the eggs with the yoghurt and brush the mixture over the pies. Bake them for about 40 minutes until they are cooked through and have a lovely golden crust.

Put the lentils into a bowl. Cover with water and set aside to soak.
Put the potatoes into a saucepan, cover with water and bring to the boil. Turn the heat down and simmer for 15–18 minutes until just tender.
Heat the oil in a large sauté pan, add the onions and cook over a medium heat for 5–6 minutes until just softening.
Add the garlic, thyme, oregano and cinnamon and cook for 1 minute, stir in the tomato purée and cook for a further minute.
Add the tomatoes, salt and pepper and bring to a simmer. Fill the tomato tin with water and add to the pan. Do this another two times and add the stock cube (this should be 800ml/1pint 8fl oz of water in total).
Drain the lentils and stir into the tomato sauce, bring to the boil and simmer over a medium heat, stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes until the lentils are soft and the liquid nearly all absorbed.
Meanwhile, drain the potatoes and run under cold water until cool enough to hold. Using a spoon, scrape the skin off of the potatoes, then cut into slices about 7mm/⅜in thick and set aside (if using new potatoes, keep the skin on).
Heat a griddle pan until hot then griddle the aubergine in batches until browned and softened.
Spoon half the lentil sauce into a medium ovenproof dish then layer half the potatoes and aubergines over the top. Top with the remaining lentils, potatoes and aubergines.
Put the ricotta into a small bowl and stir in the grated cheese. Spoon the mixture over the aubergines and smooth out to cover the top.
Bake in the oven for 20–25 minutes, or until heated through and golden brown.
Serve with a green salad.",,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/red_lentil_and_aubergine_33187

Chicken and chorizo paella,30,6 serving(s),https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/food/ic/food_16x9_832/recipes/chicken_and_chorizo_33509_16x9.jpg,"['1–2 tbsp oil', '12 whole chicken pieces (legs or thighs), on the bone', '1 chorizo sausage, sliced into 3mm/⅛in thick slices', '1 large onion, finely chopped', '3 garlic cloves, crushed', '2 red peppers, seeds removed, sliced', '2–3 red chillies, seeds removed, chopped', '2 tsp smoked paprika', '1.5 litres/2½ pints chicken stock', '400g/14oz paella rice', '12 mussels or clams, (optional) cleaned, open and damaged shells discarded', 'handful parsley, roughly chopped']","Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4.
Heat the oil in a large, lidded, heatproof pan or paella pan. Fry the chicken until the pieces are evenly browned, turning them regularly as they cook. You may need to do this in two batches, depending on the size of your pan. Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside.
Fry the slices of chorizo in the pan until crisp. They will release their juices into the pan, which adds a lot of flavour to the dish. Add the onion to the pan, and cook gently until soft, then add the garlic and fry for a further 2–3 minutes. Add the red peppers, chillies and smoked paprika, cook for another 2–3 minutes. Return the chicken pieces to the pan and pour in the stock. Simmer gently for 20–25 minutes until the chicken is tender.
Add the rice to the pan, cover with the lid and put into the preheated oven. Cook for 30 minutes, or until all the liquid has been absorbed and the rice is cooked. Alternatively, if using a paella pan which won’t fit in the oven, cover tightly with foil and continue cooking on the stove over a low heat for the same cooking time. If using mussels or clams, add them to the pan for the final 20 minutes cooking time. Discard any shells that remain closed after cooking. Check the chicken is cooked by piercing the thickest part of a piece with a skewer – if the juices run clear the chicken is cooked.
Sprinkle with parsley before bringing the pan to the table. Let your guests help themselves.",,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/chicken_and_chorizo_33509
