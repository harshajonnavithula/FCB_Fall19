If you want to support only local family-owned farms and are flexible about what you cook, join a traditional C.S.A. that connects you with a farm in your area. Ask the farmers at your local market if they have a C.S.A. program, or go online; many farms have websites for C.S.A. members.

If you want your C.S.A. to be your primary source for fresh food, join a delivery service that collects both produce and products like eggs, bread, cheese and fish from multiple sources. The service should be clear about whether the food is local, organic or both.

If you cannot commit to a pickup time, buy farm boxes from on-demand services like Peapod or FreshDirect, which arrive only when you order them. If you want to know exactly where the food is coming from, ask whether the boxes are put together at the farm, or packed by the company.

If you need a consistent supply of organic fruit and vegetables, join an organic-only C.S.A. or produce-delivery service that collects produce from many different regions. This will protect you from being limited to the seasonal produce in your growing area.
