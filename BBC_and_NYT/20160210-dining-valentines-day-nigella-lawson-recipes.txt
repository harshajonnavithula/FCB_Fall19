What’s better than a dozen roses for Valentine’s Day? One of these recipes from Nigella Lawson. Here, and on our Pinterest board, you’ll find a breakfast casserole, romantic main courses and chocolate galore.

This decadent casserole is filled with croissants, split and stuffed with ham and cheese.
There is nothing to stop you from serving spiced beef in red wine at a dinner party, but proper cooking should not be undertaken only for company. This recipe can be made ahead and frozen in single (or double) portions.
This is a version of coq au vin that is easier to make and just as delicious.

Scale this recipe up for two, or more, if you plan company.

Here is a main course you can prep up to two days ahead of time. The marinating chicken gets more tender as time goes on.

This citrus dessert can be made ahead of time for the most part. Mix lemon and lime zest with eggs, sugar and cream, and then refrigerate for up to two days – the longer the better. Then, bake it in ramekins for about a half-hour, and serve.

This chocolate shortcake is a more sophisticated version of strawberry shortcake.

This is a subtle cake: The coffee tempers the sweetness, and the buttery sweetness keeps it all mellow. Even if you don’t make cakes, this one is a cinch.
A chocolate cake is the basic unit of celebration. The chocolate Guinness cake here is simple but deeply pleasurable, and has earned its place as a stand-alone treat.

This is a fancy restaurant dessert that’s easy to make at home: Mix up the little cakes, stash them in the fridge for a day, and then take them out as you sit down to your meal, popping them in the oven just 10 minutes or so before serving them with a dollop of vanilla or pistachio ice cream.

Think ponds of molten chocolate sauce enclosed in chewy-topped, dense chocolate sponge.

A slice of this, with a smattering of fresh raspberries and a dollop of cream, or better still, sour cream, is the perfect finale.
