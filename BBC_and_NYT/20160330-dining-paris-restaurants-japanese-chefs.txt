A new generation of Japanese chefs is opening the kind of small, ambitious and informal restaurants that have changed the city’s culinary landscape in the past decade. Here are six worth visiting.

Cramped, loud and exquisite. This is contemporary French cuisine at its most honest and raw. Parisians come to be dazzled by Katsuaki Okiyama’s expressive food, not purred over by a doting maître d’hôtel. Tasting menu 48 euros ($54) a person.

It could get by on looks alone. The circus-themed, landmark interior (Clown Bar is close to the Cirque d’Hiver) dates to the 1920s, and it is as delightful as it is unique. But you go for the strange and wonderful natural wines, and also for Sota Atsumi’s delicate interpretations of classic French dishes. Starters from 12 euros; main courses from 19 euros.

A multicourse set menu paired with cocktails could be too conceptual in the wrong hands, but it works here, where the food of the chef Taku Sekine is matched note for note by the drinks of Amaury Guyot. Five-course dinner menu 45 euros a person; with cocktail pairings, 95 euros a person.

Opened by the husband-and-wife team of Dai and Tomoko Shinozuka, this is the refined bistro you dream of visiting, one that’s relaxing, informal and welcoming, and where you will be served food that will linger in your memory. Three-course dinner menu 40 euros a person.

The small dining room in the historic Passage des Panoramas is intimate, sophisticated and discreet. Shinichi Sato’s food is luxurious and technically stunning, haute cuisine polished to a high gloss. Tasting menu 150 euros a person.

In the basement below Atsushi Tanaka’s polished restaurant, where the tasting menu costs 95 euros a person, is a rough hewn cave where you can cobble together a meal with tasty bar snacks and a bottle or two from the impressive selection of natural wines. Small plates from 10 euros.
