Summer is unofficially upon us, and what better way to welcome it than with a spectacular Memorial Day cookout? Here’s everything you need to know to lift your grilling game, pick the perfect hot-weather beers and more. Your summer is going to be just delicious.

Grilling is like riding a bike. Once you’ve learned how to do it, you’ll remember. But every so often, it’s worthwhile to revisit the basics and review best practices.

Haul out the shorts, pop on the shades, wriggle the bare feet in the grass or sand. Only one more thing is necessary for utter relaxation: beer. Memorial Day weekends in particular call for a celebratory brew.

Burgers, brats, dips … what will you cook up this weekend? Find new Memorial Day cooking ideas for meat eaters, vegans and vegetarians before the big party.

Chicken wings are definitely not just for game days. Impress your friends with this simple smoky wings recipe from Sam Sifton.

Improve your grilling skills by listening to the experts. Chefs cook over open fire all the time. Maybe this is the year you make like the chef Robbie Wilson at Bird Dog in Palo Alto, Calif., and grill a peeled avocado. He serves his with ponzu sauce.

Don’t just think of your grill as a means to cook a steak. Treat it like an extension of your kitchen. Use it like an oven. Grill or bake in cast iron over the flames.

Once you’ve lit the coals and cooked your meal, it seems like a waste to let all that good heat go without cooking something else. Grill citrus, chiles and onions, and you’ll have a smoky base to make condiments and sauces later in the week.

Grilling food over an open fire is one of life’s great pleasures, at least if you set yourself up for success. Here’s our guide to the fundamentals and a handful of techniques to master, whether you’re a beginner or an advanced cook, using a gas or charcoal grill.
