For novice challah makers, the braid can seem like the hardest part of the bread recipe. Follow these simple steps to make a six-strand challah round. Scroll all the way down for a how-to video on the classic three-strand braided loaf.

To make a braided round loaf, cut dough into six equal pieces.

Roll each piece into a rope 12 inches long.

First lay three ropes parallel to one another on the work surface, leaving 1 inch between them. Take one of the remaining ropes and hold it perpendicular to the three ropes, across the center. Weave that rope through the three ropes, as if you were creating a lattice for a pie; leave the edges free. Repeat with remaining two ropes.

Starting from the ends of the three ropes closest to you, braid the loose edges of the ropes and pinch the ends together. Repeat with the remaining ends of the ropes; you should end up with a lattice in the middle with 4 braids radiating out from it.

Tuck the braids underneath the lattice to create a round loaf.
