To help celebrate The New York Times Food Festival at Bryant Park on Oct. 5 and 6, The Times invited them to bring their interpretations of street treats and lunches, sweets and cordials onto the lawn, for sample and sale.
Who are they, and what motivates their cooking? Where did they come from, and what did they dream about? Where would they like to travel? What ingredients can they not live without? Who inspires them? What do they worry about? What do they love?
We asked them questions. They responded in kind. â€” Sam Sifton, Food editor
