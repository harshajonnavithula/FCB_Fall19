The dual strategy of splaying the turkey legs to allow more hot air to circulate around them, combined with an initial searing, gives the dark meat a head start before the breast hits the heat of the oven. With this splayed turkey recipe, you get an evenly roasted bird, with silky, juicy white meat and perfectly cooked dark meat. And you get it fast, or at least faster than roasting it whole. Hereâ€™s how to do it.

Place the turkey breast side up. Using a sharp knife or kitchen shears, cut through the skin that connects the legs to the body on both sides.

Grip a thigh in one hand and pull it away from the body of the turkey, then press down until it pops out of the socket. Repeat on the other side.

Spread out the thighs so they can lie flat in a preheated roasting pan.
